# hello-world
tutorial
 I am an android  from the future  that only understands binary. My computer has complex code called 'convert personal interactions' to digital,  a PtoD converter. This is how I understand the world around me.  My main function is to stimulate and detect transitions in two-level systems to infer molecular structure and dynamics.  I have an elaborate subroutine that executes self-effacement. This enhances my interactions with humans, allowing me to mentor, teach and run a research program at a university. I spend my nights plugged into an electrical outlet.
